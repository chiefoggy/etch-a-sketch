# Etch-A-Sketch Project

This project is part of **The Odin Project's Foundation Track**, where I built a functional, interactive Etch-A-Sketch application using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Inspired by the classic drawing toy, this project brings it to the web, making it readily accessible!

## Project Overview

The project provided an excellent opportunity to practice and improve my skills in **JavaScript DOM manipulation** and **CSS Flexbox**.

## Features

- **Interactive Drawing Grid:** Users can "draw" by hovering over grid cells. The cells dynamically change color based on the user's interactions.
- **Color Selection:** Choose from predefined colors or enable a "Random Color" mode for vibrant and unpredictable patterns.
- **Grid Reset:** Clear the grid with a single click and start over.
- **Adjustable Grid Size:** Dynamically create grids of different sizes, up to a maximum of 100x100, using an intuitive grid size selector.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For the structure of the application.
- **CSS:** For layout and styling.
- **JavaScript:** For generating the grid dynamically, handling user interactions, and managing color changes.
- **Git:** For version control and maintaining the project across different stages of development.

## How to Use

1. **Start Drawing:**
   - Hover over the grid cells to "draw" on the canvas.
2. **Choose a Color:**
   - Select a predefined color button or enable "Random Color" mode to draw with random shades.
3. **Reset the Grid:**
   - Click the "Clear" button to erase the drawing.
4. **Adjust the Grid Size:**
   - Click the "New Grid" button and enter your desired grid size (up to 100x100).

## Project Highlights

- **Dynamic Grid Creation:** The grid adjusts its size and shape based on user input, maintaining flexibility and responsiveness.
- **Responsive Layout:** The application is designed to look and function well across all screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience on mobile and desktop devices.
- **Intuitive User Interface:** Simple and clean UI that mirrors the classic Etch-A-Sketch experience, making it accessible to users.

## Future Improvements

- **Save and Export Artwork:** Allow users to save their creations as images to share or reuse.
- **Custom Color Picker:** Provide a tool to let users pick any color from a color wheel.
- **Progressive Darkening Effect:** Implement a feature where each interaction with a square darkens it by 10%, allowing users to achieve a fully black square after ten interactions.
